🎓 Student CRUD Management System

A front-end web application developed using HTML5, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript (ES6) that demonstrates CRUD operations, client-side data persistence, and DOM manipulation.This project highlights practical exposure to modern web development, software engineering fundamentals, and UI/UX best practices, making it suitable for internship evaluations and fresher roles.

📄 Project Description

 The Student CRUD Management System is a browser-based student record management application designed to manage structured data efficiently. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) student information in real time with persistent storage using the Web Storage API (Local Storage).The project reflects strong understanding of frontend development concepts, event-driven programming, and clean, modular JavaScript, aligning with industry-level internship expectations.

🚀 Key Features

CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
Client-side data storage using Local Storage
Dynamic table rendering using JavaScript
Responsive design using Bootstrap 5
Interactive UI alerts using SweetAlert
Form handling and validation
Clean and reusable code structure

🛠 Technical Skills & Technologies

HTML5 – Semantic markup and form design
CSS3 & Bootstrap 5 – Responsive layout and UI styling
JavaScript (ES6) – Logic implementation, DOM manipulation
